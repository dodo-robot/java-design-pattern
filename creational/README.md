## Creational Design Patterns:

Creational design patterns are responsible for efficient object creation mechanisms, which increase the flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Inheritance vs Composition: It's always recommended that composition should be preferred over inheritance whenever possible as it let's you write code in a more flexible way, which can be modified easily.

The Factory Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Abstract Factory Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Prototype Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce new objects by copying existing ones without compromising their internals.

The Builder Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce different types and representations of an object using the same building process. Builder allows constructing complex objects step by step.

The Singleton Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to this instance.
