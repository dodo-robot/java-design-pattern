## Creational Design Patterns:

Creational design patterns are responsible for efficient object creation mechanisms, which increase the flexibility and reuse of existing code. In the world of object oriented programming, every time we need to re-use our existing code, the only thing which pops up in our mind is inheritance. Inheritance is very powerful as a concept, but with great power comes great responsibility, and if the power is misused consequences will follow.

Inheritance vs Composition: It's always recommended that composition should be preferred over inheritance whenever possible as it let's you write code in a more flexible way, which can be modified easily.

In this series, we will see how to use the power of composition over inheritance and use it up to our greatest benefits and sleep without fear of changing the code again and breaking something.

Following are the patterns which we will be learning.

The Factory Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Abstract Factory Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The Prototype Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce new objects by copying existing ones without compromising their internals.

The Builder Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you produce different types and representations of an object using the same building process. Builder allows constructing complex objects step by step.

The Singleton Pattern - It's a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global access point to this instance.
