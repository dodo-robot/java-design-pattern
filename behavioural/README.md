##  Behavioral Design Patterns:

Behavioral patterns are responsible for the efficient and safe distribution of behaviors among the program's objects.

Inheritance vs Composition: It's always recommended that composition should be preferred over inheritance whenever possible as it let's you write code in a more flexible way, which can be modified easily.

### The Chain of Responsibility Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. 

###  The Command Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you turn a request into stand-alone object, which can be used to parametrize objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support un-doable operations.

###  The Iterator Pattern 

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. 

###  The Mediator Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define an object that encapsulates relations between a set of objects to make them independent of each other. 

###  The Memento Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you capture the object's internal state without exposing its internal structure, so that the object can be returned to this state later.

###  The Observer Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

### The State Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. 

### The Strategy Pattern

It s a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it. 

### The Template Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define the skeleton of an algorithm and allow sub-classes to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 

### The Visitor Pattern

It is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the objects on which it operates.
