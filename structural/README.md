## Structural Design Patterns:

Structural design patterns are responsible for building simple and efficient class hierarchies and relations between different classes.

Inheritance vs Composition: It's always recommended that composition should be preferred over inheritance whenever possible as it let's you write code in a more flexible way, which can be modified easily.

###  The Adaptor Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

###  The Bridge Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you split a giant class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies, abstraction and implementation, which can be developed independently of each other.

###  The Composite Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and allow clients to work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

###  The Decorator Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing them inside wrapper objects that contain these behaviors.

###  The Proxy Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

###  The Facade Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you provide a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

###  The Flyweight Pattern

It's a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of object state among multiple objects, instead of keeping it in each object.
